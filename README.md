# Project EulerÂ 
Here I put my own solutions to the problems asked on projecteuler.net, where I learn math, programming, and better reasoning along the way.

In this project, I will also include the solutions in different programming languages.

Why? Because I enjoy programming and how these algorithms can be greatly optimized with a little math knowledge. I also find it interesting how and why computers can do these tasks so fast.
