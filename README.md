# Project Euler

Here i put my made solutions to the problems asked on projecteuler.net where i learn math, programming and reasoning along the way.
In this project I also hope to include the solution in other programming languages.

Why?: I love programming and how (a bit of) math can make enormous optimaztions to these algorithms. I also find it interesting how and that computers can do these tasks so fast.
